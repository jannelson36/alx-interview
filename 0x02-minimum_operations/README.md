# Minimum Operations

This project contains the minimum operations coding challenge.

## Task :page_with_curl:

+ [x] 0. **Minimum Operations**<br/>[0-minoperations.py](0-minoperations.py) includes a script with the following requirements:
  + In a text file, there is a single character `H`. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: `Copy All` and `Paste`. Given a number `n`, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly `n` `H` characters in the file.
    + Prototype: `def minOperations(n)`.
    + `boxes` is a list of lists.
    + Returns an integer.
    + If `n` is impossible to achieve, return `0`.
